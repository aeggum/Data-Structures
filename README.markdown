Data Structures
===============

This is a completely random repository that I decided to make.  
It is just for personal use, keeping a variety of different data structures and algorithms that I think are good to know.
Having them on github will make it easier for me to remember them from time to time.  

Beyond that, there are a few goals for the repository, I suppose. 

Try to optimize any of the structures that are added.  This would be ongoing.
Have a main() method that uses each of the structures or algorithms in one way or another.  Maybe comparing the data structure or algorithm with the 'best' (ie. built-in algorithms).
